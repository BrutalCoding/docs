# atDirectory

In order for an atSign to communicate with another one on the internet, we need to locate the atServer that can send and receive information securely on its behalf. This location is found using the AtDirectory service (root.atsign.org). This directory returns the DNS address and port number of the atServer for any atSign that it has a record for. The atDirectory service contains no information about the owner of the atSign.

# Flutter

Our Dart/Flutter SDK takes full advantage of the atProtocol and implements all the necessary features like encryption key generation, cram & pkam authentication, verb building, end-to-end encrypted data sharing, encrypting self data, and much more.

### What’s Covered <a href="#whats-covered" id="whats-covered"></a>

This is where you can quickly learn and update yourself on various atPlatform concepts.

If you haven’t already, we recommend you head to [Get Started Flutter Development](https://dev3.atsign.wtf/start/flutter/) first.

The following is covered in this codelab:

* [**Onboarding**](https://dev3.atsign.wtf/sdk/flutter/onboarding/) - process of activating an atSign and/or authenticating the atSign into its secondary server.
* [**AtClientPreference**](https://dev3.atsign.wtf/sdk/flutter/at\_client\_preference/) - object used to configure preferences in your atPlatform application such as the namespace, hiveStoragePath, and maxDataSize.
* [**AtClientManager**](https://dev3.atsign.wtf/sdk/flutter/at\_client\_manager/) - an object with various services such the Client, the NotificationService, and the SyncService.
* [**Key Basics**](https://dev3.atsign.wtf/sdk/flutter/key\_basics/) - learn how keys are stored in the atServer and how to manipulate them.
